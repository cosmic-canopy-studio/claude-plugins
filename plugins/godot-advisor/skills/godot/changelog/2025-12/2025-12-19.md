# 2025-12-19 - Progressive Disclosure Architecture

## Summary

Major restructuring of Godot skill system from 120+ individual skills to a unified progressive disclosure architecture.

## Motivation

The previous system had:
- 46+ SKILL.md files (87% reduction target)
- 46+ patterns.md files (83% reduction target)
- 46+ reference.md files (83% reduction target)
- 200+ example files (60% reduction target)

Problems:
- High cognitive load for skill discovery
- Difficulty tracking changes across skills
- Token overhead when loading multiple skills
- No clear "where do I start?" entry point

## Changes

### New Architecture

└── index.yaml            # Searchable metadata
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Route by use case, not node type**: Users ask "how do I make the player move?" not "what can CharacterBody2D do?"

2. **Progressive disclosure tiers**:
   - Tier 1 (Core): Quick starts and common patterns
   - Tier 2 (Detailed): Full API coverage and edge cases
   - Tier 3 (Examples): Complete working code

3. **Searchable index**: `when_to_use` triggers enable keyword-based lookup

4. **Date-based versioning**: YYYY.MM.DD format tracks changes over time

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Entry point explaining the system |
| `index.yaml` | Searchable metadata with 45 topics |
| `dispatchers/2d-gameplay.md` | 2D game development routing |
| `dispatchers/3d-gameplay.md` | 3D game development routing |
| `dispatchers/ui-systems.md` | UI development routing |
| `dispatchers/audio-systems.md` | Audio system routing |
| `dispatchers/game-patterns.md` | Architecture patterns routing |
| `changelog/CHANGELOG.md` | Master changelog |
| `changelog/2025-12/2025-12-19.md` | This file |

## Next Steps

1. Consolidate existing skill content into reference clusters
2. Curate examples by pattern (not by node)
3. Delete individual `godot-*` skill directories
4. Update agents to use new lookup system
