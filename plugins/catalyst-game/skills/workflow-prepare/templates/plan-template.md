# [Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[1-2 sentence summary of what we're building and why]

## Current State

[What exists now, key files involved, current behavior]

Key files:
- `path/to/file.gd` - [what it does, why relevant]
- `path/to/other.gd` - [what it does, why relevant]

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT part of this implementation:
- [Related feature that might seem included]
- [Optimization that can wait]
- [Edge case we're deferring]

## Phase 1: [Name]

### Changes

- `path/to/file.gd` - [what to change and why]

### Success Criteria

**Automated:**
- [ ] `gdlint path/to/file.gd` passes
- [ ] `[test command]` passes

**Manual:**
- [ ] [Human verification step]

## Phase 2: [Name]

### Changes

- `path/to/file.gd` - [what to change and why]

### Success Criteria

**Automated:**
- [ ] `[command]` passes

**Manual:**
- [ ] [Human verification step]

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
- [How to run automated verification]

### Manual Testing
