# Status Generator

## Quick Start

| You Say | Result |
|---------|--------|
| "Create a status update for X" | Status report with accomplishments and blockers |
| "Weekly update for leadership" | Executive-focused status with decisions needed |
| "What's the progress on this initiative?" | Structured status with metrics and next steps |

## Announcement
"I'm using the status-generator to create your status update..."

## Process
1. Gather context from plans, conversations, or user input
2. Summarize accomplishments since last update
3. Identify blockers and risks with resolution paths
4. List decisions needed with context
5. Plan next period work items
6. Output structured status

## Output
Status update with:
- Summary with overall status (🟢/🟡/🔴)
- Completed items this period
- In-progress items with % complete
- Blockers & risks with mitigation
- Decisions needed with options
- Next period planned work
- Metrics with trends

## Audience Tailoring
- **Leadership**: Outcomes, metrics, strategic blockers, decisions needed
- **Team**: Tactical detail, dependencies, technical context

## Transitions
- **Before**: User has project context or asks for update
- **After**: task-breakdown (if planning needed) or decision-documenter (if decisions made)
